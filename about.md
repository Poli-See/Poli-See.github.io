The Poli-See blog explores local policy planning and decisions through a community-centered lens. From bike lanes to garbage pick-up schedules, we want to discuss how planning and policy decisions at the community level -- both small and large -- can be designed to target lasting positive change for the individuals, families and businesses they affect.

### Discuss, Engage, Question or Contact Us

We're all about hearing what you think and getting a diversity of opinons on the issues that make our local communities tick. You can also [e-mail us](mailto:poliseeblog@gmail.com).
